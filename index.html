      <h2>Machine Learning</h2>

      <p>Machine learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) that provides systems the ability to automatically
        learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development
        of computer programs that can access data and use it learn for themselves.
        <br>The process of learning begins with observations or data, such as examples, direct experience, or instruction, in
        order to look for patterns in data and make better decisions in the future based on the examples that we provide.
        The primary aim is to allow the computers learn automatically without human intervention or assistance and adjust
        actions accordingly.
        <br> Machine learning enables analysis of massive quantities of data. While it generally delivers faster, more accurate
        results in order to identify profitable opportunities or dangerous risks, it may also require additional time and
        resources to train it properly. Combining machine learning with AI and cognitive technologies can make it even more
        effective in processing large volumes of information.

          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>Machine learning is a part of artifical intelligence which mainly being use for developing models of data that
            being observed. The developed models of data compute by machine learning method are gained by programming the
            computer to learn and identify the pattern of data. The model will try to identify the model by finding patterns
            in the data and tries to provide the result by making prediction of data as the output</p>
          <p>The pattern being discovered must generate some meaning or relate to the real condition where the data being collected,
            in order to consider the output pattern lead to some advantage or provide benefits</p>
          <p>
            To make the process of develop data modelling using machine learning method, one should understand and study machine learning
            algorithms. Using the algorithms of machine learning helps to build and generate model that helps to learn the
            mistakes from the past and minimize possible error that could happen over time.
          </p>
          <p>How model works
            <br> To train the algorithms we feed it with training data. A training set is the set of training examples whis is
            use to train our machine learning algorithms. To test machine learning algorithms we need to have a separate
            dataset, called a test data.
            <br> Initially the program is trained with training examples, next the test data is fed to the program. The class
            (predicted value) for each examples is not given with the testing data, and the program decides which class each
            example should belong to. The target variable or class that the training example belongsto is then compared to
            the predicted value, to know the accuracy of the algorithm.

          <h3 id="Methods">Machine Learning Methods</h3>
          <h1>Supervised machine learning</h1>
          <p>In supervised learning the model is trained with labeled data then the algorithms predict the output from input
            data. The model becomes in charge of data and we tell the model what to predict.
            <br> Some examples of supervised machine learning algorithm include : K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Naive Bayes, Support
            Vector Machine (SVM) and decision trees
          </p>
          <h3>Unsupervised machine learning</h3>
          <p>In Unsupervised learning the model is trained with unlabelled data then the algorithms learn to inherent patterns
            from the input data. In this algorithm, the model has no idea about the data but tries to find grouping in data.
            <br> Some example of Unsupervised machine learning algorithm are : k-means clustering and DBSCAN.</p>
          <p>Reinforcement learning
            <br> in involves the model to learn from its past errors and correct it in the next iteration. In this way the model
            improves its results. Think of it as the algorithms that optimize the life of measured data.
          </p>
          <p>Overfitting
            <br> Overfitting means a model has trained too well and because of which the noisy data or the outliers of the data
            are also considered as the part of the real data. It negatively impacts the performance of the model on new data.
            In Overfitting the model effectively memorizes the data and predicts the output, but its accuracy will become
            poor when there is completely new data point.

          </p>
          <p>Underfitting
            <br>Underfitting means a model that can neither model the training data not generalize to new data. An underfitt
            machine learning model is not a suitable model because it will have poor performance on the training data. It
            happens when a model doesn't take into account enough information to accurately model real life.

          <h3>Linear Regression</h3>
          <p>
            Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm which is used for prediction problems. It is a method to predict the
            target variable by finding the best fit line between the independent and dependent variable. The best fit is
            the line with minimum error from all the points.
          </p>

        <article>
          <h3>Decision Trees</h3>
          <p>Decision trees are supervised learning method used for classification and regression. The goal is to create a model
            that predicts the value of a target variable by learning simple decision rules inferred from the data features.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Naive Bayes</h3>
          <p>Naive bayes is a supervised machine learning algorithm which is used to classify data into predefined classes.
            It uses the concept of conditional probability to classify the test data.</p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN)</h3>
          <p>K-Nearest Neighbor is the simplest machine learning algorithm that is used for classification problems (supervised
            learning). Whenever the model is fed with a testing data it finds the distance of that point with every other
            point in the training data. Then it finds nearest k members for that point. </p>
        </article>
        <article>
          <h3>Support Vector Machine (SVM)</h3>
          <p>Support vector machine is a supervised machine learning algorithm which can be used for both classification and
            regression problems. The goal of SVM is to find the hyperplane which divides the two classes of data. </p>

          <h3 id="data_preprocessing">Data Preprocessing</h3>
          <p>
            The data that we usually get is raw data which cannot be used directly to train the model. We need to preprocess the data
            so the model accurately predicts the output. The real world data are generally noisy i.e. contains errors, inconsistent
            and incomplete. Because of these reasons data preprocessing is a important part of machine learning.
          </p>
          <ol>
            Types of data preprocessing:
            <li>
              Data cleaning
            </li>
            <li>
              Data reduction
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>Data cleaning There is some method to clean the data. The method that usually being used include :
            <ol>
              <li>Fill in missing values</li>
              <li>Smooth out noisy data (using binning)</li>
              <li>Outlier removal methods</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
          <p>Data reduction Some process to reduce the data include the following:
            <ol>
              <li>Reducing the number of attributes</li>
              <li>Reducing the number of attribute values</li>
              <li>Reducing the number of tuples</li>
            </ol>
          </p>
